h2. Support

* "Issue tracker":https://github.com/textmate/git.tmbundle/issues
* "Repository":https://github.com/textmate/git.tmbundle

The "Mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/git-tmbundle has now been closed. Please feel free to report issues using the "Issue tracker":https://github.com/textmate/git.tmbundle/issues.

h2. Theme notes:

The "Git Commit Message" Language defines two scopes that can be used by a theme to generate "line too long" warnings for the first line of the commit:

* invalid.deprecated.line-too-long.git-commit
* invalid.illegal.line-too-long.git-commit

The warning scope triggers when the first line exceeds 50 characters; the error scope over 65 characters. These aren't generally-used TextMate scopes, so you can add new rules to your preferred themes, such as orange background/red background. You can also edit the regex to change the preferred character counts.
